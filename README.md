# Design and Structure

## Structure

The site is made up of eight pages.
* Base.html: contains the html boiler plate which was used to extend onto the other pages. It contains the navigation bar and all the neccesary files to run the website.
* Stats.html: is the main/home page. This is where all the user inputs are displayed in a uniform manor.
* Profile.html: contains the same information as stats.html with the addition of the update and delete functions, which are prompted via the click of buttons.
* edit_car and add_car.html: both contain the same form where the user can add information about their vehicles or update once added.
* login and register.html: both pages have the same format and allow the user to register and login and logout once the user has created an account.
* 404.html: is a page the user is directed to if they enter an incorrect url and it allows them to return to the home page via a "Click here" prompt.

### Colors

* Teal:  In the context of Car Hub, teal serves as the primary color, reflecting a premium and elegant feel for car enthusiasts. The use of teal throughout the site aims to evoke a sense of luxury and excellence, enhancing the overall visual appeal.
* White: In Car Hub, white is strategically incorporated within teal elements to provide a clean appearance. This combination enhances readability.
* Red: In the context of Car Hub, red is specifically used for actions related to the deletion of files. This bold color choice serves to signify the irreversible nature of file deletion, acting as a visual cue to users that this action should be approached with caution.

### Languages Used

* [Javascript/Jquery](https://jquery.com/) Why I Used It: JavaScript is my go-to language for creating dynamic and interactive features on my web pages. Such as the modal and to initialize materialize.
* [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/) Why I Used It: Jinja, integrated with my Python web framework (Flask), serves as a templating engine.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) Why I Used It: Python, being a versatile and high-level programming language, is my backend powerhouse. It works in tandem with my web framework to handle server-side logic, manage routes, interact with databases, and coordinate the overall functionality of Car Hub.
